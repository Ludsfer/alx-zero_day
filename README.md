My first readme


I used **mkdir** to create directories
I sued **touch** to create files
I used **vim** to edit my files
I stage changes made to my files wit **git add .**
and commit chagit to the remote directory with the code **git commit -m 'message of my commit'**
I created a new branch with **git branch 'name of the branch'**
switched between branches with **git checkout 'name of the branch'**
I sychronise the local directory with the remote by using **'git push'**
